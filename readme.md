<h1> Raspberry Pi 3 Shenanigans </h1>
Various small project I plan to run on rasberry pi. Primarily it will scrape information from various websites, compress it to keep the small SD-card from getting full and send the information to another machine for storage when promted.

<h2> Scraping </h2>
A small library of methods to help make scraping easy. Currently can only handle the raw HTML-code from servers. Sites using a lot of Java-script etc. can not be scraped well.

<h2> Server </h2>
Some server functionality to set up the Pi as a server. As it scrapes various websites for interesting information, it will compress it untill it receive a request to send it to another machine where we can store information.

<h2> Compression </h2>
Me messing around with compression.
